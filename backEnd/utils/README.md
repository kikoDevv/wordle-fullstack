# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helpers:

- `wordUtils.js` - Functions for word processing and feedback generation
- `timeUtils.js` - Functions for timing game sessions
- `filterUtils.js` - Functions for filtering highscores by settings (for VG task)

Utility functions should be pure functions that can be tested in isolation.
