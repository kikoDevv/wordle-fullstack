# Models Directory

This directory contains database models for the application:

- `Score.js` - Model for the highscore entries (player name, time, guesses, word settings)
- `Word.js` - Model for managing words from the word list file

For persistence, set up a database connection (MongoDB, SQLite, etc.) and define schemas for your data.
