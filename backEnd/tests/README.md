# Tests Directory

This directory contains test files for the application:

- `word.test.js` - Tests for word selection functionality
- `score.test.js` - Tests for score submission and retrieval
- `game.test.js` - Integration tests for the game flow

For the VG option, implement tests with mocked word selection to ensure predictable test results.
Configure the test suite to run with "npm test".
