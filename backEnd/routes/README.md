# Routes Directory

This directory contains API route definitions:

- `wordRoutes.js` - Routes for word selection API
- `scoreRoutes.js` - Routes for submitting scores and retrieving highscores
- `viewRoutes.js` - Routes for server-side rendered pages (highscore list)

Routes should be modular and use the controllers to handle request processing.
