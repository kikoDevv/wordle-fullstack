# Middleware Directory

This directory contains middleware functions:

- `errorHandler.js` - Global error handling middleware
- `validation.js` - Input validation middleware for API requests
- `gameState.js` - Middleware to track game state (for VG option to prevent cheating)

Middleware functions can be used to process requests before they reach the route handlers or for cross-cutting concerns.
